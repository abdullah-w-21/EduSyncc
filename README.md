cd EduSyncc
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your Groq API key:
   - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file
   - Add your API key:
     ```toml
     GROQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
     ```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
```

## üíª Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Navigate to the different sections using the sidebar:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of system metrics and insights
   - **Curriculum Management**: Set up and manage curriculum content
   - **Content Analysis**: Upload and analyze educational materials
   - **Network Monitor**: Track network performance and manage downloads

### Setting Up Curriculum

1. Navigate to "Curriculum Management"
2. Use the "Add New Curriculum Content" form to input:
   - Grade Level
   - Subject
   - Topic
   - Learning Objectives
   - Prerequisites
3. Click "Add to Curriculum" to save

### Analyzing Content

1. Go to "Content Analysis"
2. Choose between:
   - Upload files directly
   - Provide content URLs
3. The system will automatically:
   - Extract content
   - Analyze alignment with curriculum
   - Generate learning objectives
   - Schedule downloads if needed

### Monitoring Network Performance

1. Access "Network Monitor"
2. Features available:
   - Run speed tests
   - View network history
   - Check download queue
   - See network predictions
   - Process download queue

## üîß Configuration

### Network Optimization Settings
```python
MIN_DOWNLOAD_SPEED = 5.0  # Minimum acceptable speed in Mbps
PEAK_HOURS = range(9, 18)  # 9 AM to 6 PM
PEAK_MIN_SPEED = 10.0  # Minimum speed during peak hours
```

### Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following tables:

- `speed_tests`: Network performance data
- `content_analysis`: Analyzed content information
- `download_schedule`: Download queue management
- `curriculum`: Curriculum structure and requirements
